## Why?

We decided to work on this because we wanted to have the flexibility to choose a few locations to travel, the months that we want to go, the week days that we are able to travel and the amount of days that we want to stay in the place. On most of the current websites you need to choose a specific date, or in some other cases you can search in the entire month to see the best prices. The problem for us with the existing "price alerts" is that we normally are restricted to a specific date or the system sends us good prices of random dates in one specific month. Most of the times we end up not buying the ticket. With our app we can select to travel to London, for example, in the months of April and August always flying on a Thursday or Friday for 3 days of vacation. That results in a price alert more likely to be converted into a buy.

## Process

### 1 - Benchmarking and Flight tickets website analysis

To get inspired for the app we analysed the Skyscanner, Cheap tickets,  Virgin America, KLM and Kayak. This phase was important to understand the requirements to buy a ticket and to see how these companies solved similar problems.
