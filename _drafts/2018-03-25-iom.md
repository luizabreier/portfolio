excerpt: The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is the United Nations’ migration agency dedicated to promoting humane and orderly migration through providing services and advice to governments and migrants. As an organization, they need to report their data to the International Aid Transparency Initiative Standard,  a technical publishing framework allowing data to be compared. This allows them to be transparent as an organisation and we are experts on this at Zimmerman & Zimmerman. The challenge for me as a designer is to analyse all their raw data to be able to optimise them in simple data visualization interfaces.

## Requirements

For  IOM’s data platform it is important to show all the detailed information about:
 - each country where they have projects;
 - their donors and the amount of contributions  they receive;
 - technical information about each project according to IATI Standard;
 - the hierarchy and categorisation of services areas and projects ;
 - Yearly comparison of the high level organisational data;

## Process

### 1 - Research and User Stories

At Zimmerman & Zimmerman we use the process of having a workshop with a list of different personas of the platform to understand their needs. For each persona that we interview we try to understand what they need to use on the platform and why they need this specific data or visualization. With all this information, we start analysing what is compatible to our product and which user stories we need to create for the new features.

### 2 - Workflow

The first challenge of the workflow was to understand the organisation’s structure. Understanding their process of receiving fundings, distributing the donations in countries and how this affects their projects was essential to have a flow that makes sense for their personas.

### 3 - Data analysis

To be able to see the whole picture of the organisation’s data, I decided to print part of the spreadsheet and hang it to the wall. This facilitated the process of deciding how to present the data as simple as possible.

Example: we had the number of donors that they have and how much money each one donate to IOM. They have more than X donors, so it is impossible to show in a bar chart, for example. We decided to use the "Treemap", because with that we can easily show the number of donors and we could differentiate them according to the amount of  donations. As result, we have a map with all the donors and the size of the square depends on the amount of the donations.

### 4 - Wireframes

This phase was super important to see if we understood all of IOM’s data and if we were on the same page.

### 5 - Visual Design

We had three rounds of visual design using InVision to validate the usability and the use of their brand guidelines.
