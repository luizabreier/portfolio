# Pricing

Pricing is a module for managing prices, taxes and promotions of the platform VTEX. I worked on this module for six months as the only designer and focused on delivering the interfaces of pricing rules, psychological pricing and some UI improvements at the list price.

&nbsp;
## Pricing rules

The pricing rules are used when you want to change the price of one commercial policy without changing the base price of the others policies. They are also used to change the price of all products in one category and/ or brand.

&nbsp;
## The problem

Until that time, VTEX users could not specify prices with different values depending on the commercial policy.

## Psychological pricing

The concept of psychological pricing aims at "rounding" prices in order to avoid broken values and to make them commercially advantageous to the final client.

To have rounded prices, the users need to create a rule. In this rule, they choose the pricing range that will be rounded off,  the decimal point and the rounding method. They can create rules for cents, tenth of cent or unit and can choose between three rounding methods: "nine, "nines" and "zero".

&nbsp;
## The problem

One of the biggest requests made by customers was to have the possibility to round their prices after they apply promotions or the markup. We saw that stores have a pattern concerning all prices with the end x.00 or x.90, for example. We made a search in order to find out the most common rounds and create the rules described above. Besides that, we were concerned about having an area for the users to test their prices and see examples of rounding based on the rules chosen; that is essential to understand how the rules affect your prices.

## Pricing list

The list price is the main place to manage the prices of the store. The first modification that I did on this screen was to take out all the "eyes" and "pencils" icons, because they made the interface heavy and crowded with information. So, to open the sidebar, I created a motion as the mouse hovers the commercials policies. Besides that, I made some changes to simplify the sidebar and I created the options "fixed prices" and "list price" with short descriptions to help users decide if they want these prices.
